In January 2016, she became the youngest female player to be selected and play for the U.S. national team during an Olympic qualifying tournament.\r\n\r\nAfter playing extensively with the U–17 and U–20 teams, Pugh first appeared for the United States senior national team on January 23, 2016 in an international friendly against Ireland. At 17, she was the youngest player to debut for the national team since Heather O'Reilly's debut in 2002. Pugh scored in the 83rd minute in her first appearance, becoming the 19th United States player to score in her debut. Shortly after her debut, Pugh was one of the 18 players chosen to represent the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was there that Pugh scored her first Olympic goal against Colombia, giving the United States a 2–1 lead. Her goal also made her the youngest player to ever score a goal for the United States in an Olympic game. Pugh has represented the United States at the FIFA Women's World Cup tournament in 2019. At 21, she was the second youngest member of the 2019 team behind 20-year-old Tierna Davidson.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 2017, Pugh made the announcement that she would forgo her college career with UCLA and turn professional. On May 13, 2017, it was announced that Mallory Pugh had signed to play with Washington Spirit after negotiations to get to Portland Thorns FC had failed.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Desiree Rose Marie Scott (born 31 July 1987) is a Canadian soccer player who plays as a midfielder for National Women's Soccer League club Kansas City Current and the Canadian national team.\r\n Nicknamed \"the destroyer\", she is also a member of the Canadian national team, with whom she won Olympic bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nScott was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her father was born in Kingston, Jamaica, while her mother was also born in Winnipeg. She grew up participating in soccer, volleyball, track and field, and basketball. She began playing soccer at the age of eight.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Manitoba\r\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Scott played Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) soccer for the University of Manitoba. During her tenure with the Bisons, she was named a first team CIS All-Canadian in 2009. She earned Canada West All-Star honours twice and won the Canada West Rookie of the Year award in 2005.\r\n\r\nPlaying career\r\nClub\r\nVancouver Whitecaps FC\r\nScott played for the Vancouver Whitecaps FC from 2006 to 2012. In 2006, Scott appeared in five matches for the Caps (450 minutes), contributing to the team winning their second W-League title that season.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, she appeared in seven games and two playoff games for the team contributing one goal and one assist. Scott helped carry the Whitecaps to the W-League Championship where they eventually fell to Buffalo in the final.\r\n\r\nFC Kansas City\r\nIn 2013, as part of the NWSL Player Allocation, Scott joined FC Kansas City in the new National Women's Soccer League. Notts County Ladies of the English FA WSL announced that they had signed Scott in January 2014, but she was subsequently included on the list of Canadian players allocated to the NWSL for 2014.\r\n\r\nNotts County\r\n\r\nPlaying for Notts County in 2014\r\nOn 27 February 2014, after more than a month of speculation and legal delays, Scott was officially signed by Notts County of the FA WSL. She missed the first half of the 2015 season while preparing for the World Cup with Canada, but returned in time for the 2015 FA Women's Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, which County lost 1–0 to Chelsea. She left the club in February 2016 after making 20 league appearances.\r\n\r\nFC Kansas City\r\nOn 8 February 2016, it was announced that Scott would play for FC Kansas City for the 2016 season of the National Women's Soccer League via the NWSL Player Allocation.\r\n\r\nUtah Royals FC\r\nOn 15 February 2018 Canada Soccer announced that Scott would play for the Utah Royals FC during the 2018 season of the National Women's Soccer League via the NWSL Player Allocation.\r\n\r\nInternational\r\nScott has previously represented Canada on the U-16 and U-19 youth teams. After being called up to the senior squad by Carolina Morace, she debuted at the 2010 Cyprus Cup and participated in her first FIFA Women's World Cup at the 2011 event, making two substitute appearances. Under coach John Herdman, Scott became a regular pick and won a gold medal at the 2011 Pan American Games.\r\n\r\nAt the 2012 London Olympics, Scott won praise for her performances in the defensive midfield role, drawing comparison to the male player Edgar Davids. She had a major contribution for the team in the bronze medal game, clearing a ball off the line in defence of the goal to keep the score even at zero. Upon return to her native Winnipeg, Scott was serenaded with chants of her name and outbursts of song consisting of the Canadian national anthem at the Winnipeg airport. Scott took note of the welcome with pride saying that \"I’m a very emotional person. To come home and hear my name being screamed... I'm holding back tears right now.\"\r\n\r\nCoaching career\r\nScott is an assistant coach at her alma mater, University of Manitoba. She was an assistant coach for the West Kildonan Collegiate from 2003 until 2005. She also coached at the South End United Soccer Academy, and ran camps for kids while playing with the Vancouver Whitecaps and the Canadian women's national team. Scott has also run soccer clinics and camps, and was presenter and instructor for a number of different high school clubs in Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nScott has been an ambassador for the Homeless World Cup since 2014.\r\n\r\nScott is an athlete ambassador for KidSport Winnipeg, a charity that aims to remove the financial barriers to playing sport, and runs an annual soccer camp for girls on behalf of KidSport Winnipeg.",

Debinha became top-scorer of the 2014 Toppserien.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2014 she had a short loan spell between November and December together with Rosana at São José during the club's successful attempt to win both Copa Libertadores Femenina and International Women's Club Championship during that year. She returned to Norway at the beginning of 2015.\r\n\r\nFrom February 2016 to January 2017, she played for Dalian Quanjian in the Chinese Women's Super League.\r\n\r\nDebinha signed with the Western New York Flash of the United States-based National Women's Soccer League on 5 January 2017, days before the franchise announced that it had been sold and would be moved from Rochester, New York, to Cary, North Carolina. Debinha reportedly wasn't informed of the franchise's plans to move when she was signed. She reported to North Carolina and was made a starting midfielder from the start of their season, and scored the Courage's first goal in their home stadium.\r\n\r\nDebinha appeared in every regular season game for the Courage in 2017 and scored four goals. She started the semi-final game against the Chicago Red Stars but was forced to leave the game after dislocating her elbow in the 10th minute. This injury forced her to miss the Championship game, which the Courage lost 1–0 to the Portland Thorns.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Debinha was named to the NWSL Team of the Month for March. She scored eight goals during the regular season, helping the Courage win their second straight NWSL Shield. Debinha was named to the 2018 NWSL Second XI. During the play-offs she was in the starting line-up for the semi-final and final. Debinha scored in the 13th minute of the Championship game as North Carolina beat the Portland Thorns 3–0 to win the 2018 NWSL Championship.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nAfter representing Brazil in the 2010 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, Debinha made her senior debut at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara. She was named as an alternate for the Brazil squad at the 2012 London Olympics.\r\n\r\nIn December 2013 Debinha scored twice in a 3–1 win over Scotland at the 2013 Torneio Internacional de Brasília de Futebol Feminino.",

Winner of the Ballon d'Or Féminin and named The Best FIFA Women's Player in 2019, Rapinoe won gold with the national team at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and she played for the team at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup where the U.S. finished in second place. Rapinoe co-captained the national team alongside Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan from 2018 to 2020, with the team earning the Bronze medal in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. She previously played for the Chicago Red Stars, Philadelphia Independence, and MagicJack in Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), as well as Olympique Lyon in France's Division 1 Féminine.\r\n\r\nRapinoe is internationally known for her crafty style of play on the field and her activism off it. Her precise cross to Abby Wambach in the 122nd minute of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup quarterfinal match against Brazil resulted in an equalizer and eventual win for the Americans after a penalty shootout. The last-minute goal was awarded ESPN's 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year. During the 2012 London Olympics, she scored three goals and tallied a team-high four assists to lead the United States to a gold medal. She is the first player, male or female, to score a goal directly from a corner at the Olympic Games, having done so twice. She won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\r\n\r\nRapinoe is an advocate for numerous LGBT organizations, including the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and Athlete Ally. In 2013, she was awarded the board of directors Award by the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. She is sponsored by Nike, Procter & Gamble, BodyArmor, Hulu, LUNA Bar, Samsung, and DJO Global, and has appeared in multiple promotional pieces for clothing company Wildfang, as well as for Nike. In 2019, she co-founded a gender-neutral lifestyle brand, re-inc, with fellow athletes Christen Press, Tobin Heath, and Meghan Klingenberg.\r\n\r\nRapinoe is included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020.",

She first appeared for the Canada women's national soccer team at the 2002 Algarve Cup and has since made 118 appearances for the team. In 2012, as part of the Canadian Soccer Association's Centennial Celebration, she was honoured on the All-Time Canada XI women's team.\r\n\r\nMcLeod has represented Canada in four FIFA Women's World Cups: 2003 in the US, 2007 in China, 2011 in Germany and 2015 in Canada. She has played in two Olympic tournaments: 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London where she helped Canada win the bronze medal. Before joining FC Rosengård in 2015, she played professional soccer for the Vancouver Whitecaps, Washington Freedom, Dalsjöfors GoIF, Chicago Red Stars, and Houston Dash. She played collegiate soccer for the Southern Methodist University Mustangs as well as the Penn State Nittany Lions where she set several all-time records.\r\n\r\nMcLeod's most notable and controversial appearance came during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In the semi-final match against the United States on August 6, the referee ruled that McLeod had broken the six-second handling rule in the 76th minute, when Canada was leading 3–2. A free kick was given to the United States which resulted in a penalty being called on Canadian player Marie-Ève Nault after the ball struck her in the arm. The United States was given a penalty kick, which McLeod did not save. The United States ultimately won the game in overtime, eliminating Canada's chance for the gold medal.\r\n\r\nMcLeod has suffered three ACL injuries to her right knee. The most recent occurred on March 23, 2016 while playing for FC Rosengård that kept her out for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Jessica Marie McDonald (born February 28, 1988) is an American professional soccer player for Racing Louisville FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), the highest division of women's professional soccer in the United States, and the United States women's national soccer team.\r\n She previously played for the Australian W-League team Melbourne Victory as well as the Western New York Flash, Chicago Red Stars, Seattle Reign FC, Portland Thorns FC and Houston Dash.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nBorn in Phoenix, Arizona, McDonald is the daughter of Traci McDonald and Vince Myers. Her brother, Brandon McDonald, is also a professional soccer player who plays in the MLS. She attended Cactus High School in Glendale, Arizona where she played basketball all four years and ran track during her junior and senior years. In 2004 and 2006, she was a member of state championship basketball teams and was a first-team all-state and all-region selection. She was also a state champion and record holder in the 400 meters during her track and field career. She graduated Cactus High School as the school's record holder for the 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, and 4 × 400 meter relay team.\r\n\r\nMcDonald was a member of the Sereno Soccer club from 2000–2007 and helped the team win state championships each year she played for it. She helped lead Sereno to regional championships in 2003 and 2007 and played on the Surf Cup title-winning teams in 2005 and 2006. She was the MVP of the tournament in 2006.\r\n\r\nPhoenix College\r\nMcDonald attended Phoenix College during her freshman and sophomore year of college where she played soccer, basketball and track and was a member of the honors program. She was named a first-team junior college All-America in soccer and National Junior College Player of the Year. McDonald earned first-team all-conference and all-region honors and was the single-season record holder at Phoenix College for goals and assists. Also continuing to excel at basketball, McDonald earned first-team all-region and all-conference honors and was the country's number one rebounder in junior college and among the Top 30 in scoring.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\r\nAfter transferring to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill during her sophomore year, McDonald joined the North Carolina Tar Heels soccer team during the first half of the 2008 season and helped the squad ultimately win the national championship as a starting striker. McDonald scored 5 goals and had 10 assists for 20 points during the season. Despite playing in only 75 percent of the team's games her first year, she led the squad in assists.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nChicago Red Stars, 2010\r\n\r\nMcDonald during a Seattle Reign FC match on July 25, 2013\r\nIn 2010, McDonald was the second pick (fifteenth overall) by the Chicago Red Stars in the 2010 WPS Draft. She made five appearances for the squad before suffering a knee injury that required 18 months recovery. Chicago finished the regular season in sixth place with a 7–11–6 record. Following the season, the team suspended league operations in December 2010 and re-established themselves in the W-League.\r\n\r\nMelbourne Victory FC, 2012–13\r\n\r\nMcDonald playing for Melbourne Victory in 2012\r\nMcDonald signed with the Melbourne Victory FC in Australia's W-League for the 2012–13 season. She started all 13 of her appearances for the squad, scoring seven goals, and helped the squad to the Grand Final match against Sydney FC.\r\n\r\nChicago Red Stars and Seattle Reign FC, 2013\r\nIn 2013, McDonald signed with the Chicago Red Stars as a free agent for the inaugural season of the NWSL. During the pre-season, she scored four goals in the second half of a match against St. Edwards University. She made nine appearances for the Red Stars during the regular season, serving one assist, before being waived by the team in June 2013.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 2013, it was announced that McDonald had signed with the Seattle Reign FC after being waived by the Red Stars. She scored her first goal during her debut appearance for the club in a match against the Boston Breakers on July 3, 2013. Two games later, during the team's first televised match on Fox Soccer, she scored a brace against the Washington Spirit leading the Reign to a 2–1 win. McDonald finished the 2013 season with six starts in seven matches played, tallying a total of 439 minutes played. Her three goals ranked third on the squad for most goals scored – tied with teammates, Christine Nairn and Kaylyn Kyle.\r\n\r\nPortland Thorns, 2014\r\nMcDonald was traded to the Portland Thorns along with defender Rebecca Moros in late 2013 under head coach Cindy Parlow Cone, in exchange for Danielle Foxhoven. McDonald was a starting forward for the first eleven games of the 2014 season, then mostly relegated to a substitute position as Alex Morgan returned from an injury. The team-leading scorer for the Thorns in 2014, McDonald had eleven goals, including a July 17 goal 33 seconds in against Chicago: the fastest goal in NWSL history. This would be her only season in Portland, where she played as number 14 for a total of 1310 minutes in 24 regular-season games under head coach Paul Riley.\r\n\r\nHouston Dash, 2015\r\nOn January 16, 2015 McDonald was traded by the Thorns to the Houston Dash for the 13th pick in the 2015 NWSL College Draft and a second round selection in the 2016 NWSL College Draft. McDonald led the Dash's inaugural season in goals with seven during the 2016 season. She scored the game-winning goal during the team's 1–0 win over her former team the Portland Thorns in May. The Dash finished in fifth place during the regular season with a 6–8–6 record.\r\n\r\nWestern New York Flash, 2016\r\nIn January 2016, the Western New York Flash acquired McDonald in a trade that sent two international spots and one 2017 draft pick to Houston. Named Player of the Week for week 10 and to the Second XI list, McDonald finished third in the NWSL overall in goals scored (10), assists(7) shots (61), and second overall in shots on goal (34) for the 2016 season, McDonald earned her first senior team call-up for the USWNT.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Courage, 2017–present\r\nIt was announced on January 9, 2017, that the Western New York Flash was officially sold to new ownership, moved to North Carolina, and rebranded as the North Carolina Courage. In May 2017, McDonald became the first NWSL player to score 33 regular-season, career goals. She scored 4 goals in 2017, helping North Carolina win the NWSL Shield.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 McDonald played in 23 regular season games, scoring 7 goals. North Carolina broke the record for most goals scored in a season with 53. In the Semi-final McDonald scored in the 5th minute, which was the fasted goal in playoff history. North Carolina won 2-0 and advanced to their second straight final. McDonald scored twice in the NWSL Championship game as the Courage defeated the Portland Thorns 3-0. She was named Most Valuable Player of the Match. This is McDonald's second NWSL Championship.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nMcDonald has represented the United States on several youth national teams including the under-16, under-17, under-20, under-23, and the senior national team squads. In 2007, Jill Ellis named her to the U-20 roster for the 2007 Pan American Games in Brazil. The team won silver after being defeated by Brazil's senior national team 5–0 during the final. She earned her first call up to the full national team on November 2, 2016, and made her international debut on November 10 against Romania.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Alexandra Morgan Carrasco (born Alexandra Patricia Morgan; July 2, 1989) is an American professional soccer player for San Diego Wave FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), the highest division of women's professional soccer in the United States, and the United States women's national soccer team. She co-captained the United States women's national soccer team with Carli Lloyd and Megan Rapinoe from 2018 to 2020.\r\n\r\nShortly after graduating early from the University of California, Berkeley, where she played for the California Golden Bears, Morgan was drafted number one overall in the 2011 WPS Draft by the Western New York Flash. There, she made her professional debut and helped the team win the league championship. Morgan, who was 22 at the time, was the youngest player on the national team at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the team was runner-up. At the 2012 London Olympics, she scored the match-winning goal in the 123rd minute of the semi-final match against Canada. She finished 2012 with 28 goals and 21 assists, joining Mia Hamm as the only American woman to score 20 goals and provide 20 assists in the same calendar year and making her the sixth and youngest U.S. player to score 20 goals in a single season. She was subsequently named U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year and was a FIFA World Player of the Year finalist. Morgan also helped the United States win their titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cups, where she was named to the Dream Team for both tournaments, while she won the Silver Boot in 2019.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the inaugural season of the National Women's Soccer League, Morgan joined Portland Thorns FC and helped the team win the league title that year. Morgan played for the Thorns through the 2015 season, after which she was traded to first-year franchise Orlando Pride. In 2017, Morgan signed with French team Lyon, where she won the continental European treble, which included the UEFA Women's Champions League.\r\n\r\nOff the field, Morgan teamed with Simon & Schuster to write a middle-grade book series about four soccer players: The Kicks. The first book in the series, Saving the Team, debuted at number seven on The New York Times Best Seller list in May 2013. Additionally, a film starring Morgan in her acting debut, Alex & Me, was released in June 2018 where she plays a fictionalized version of herself.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Morgan was ranked by Time as the top-paid American women's soccer player, largely due to her numerous endorsement deals. Morgan, along with Canada's Christine Sinclair and Australia's Steph Catley, became the first women's soccer players to appear on the cover of FIFA video games in 2015. Morgan also appeared alongside Lionel Messi on covers of FIFA 16 sold in the United States. She was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People of 2019.",
